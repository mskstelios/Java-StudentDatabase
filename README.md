# Java-StudentDatabase

A Java-based student database management system with a **GUI** that stores and manages students' information such as name, last name, age, email, and other relevant details. The project is connected to a **MySQL database** using JDBC, allowing users to interact with the database through a graphical user interface (GUI) to add, view, update, delete, and search student records.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Add new student records with essential details such as first name, last name, age, and email.
- **View Students**: Display a list of all stored students in a table view.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify existing student data directly in the GUI.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records from the database through the interface.
- **Search Students**: Search for students by name, age, or other attributes.
- **Persistence**: Student records are stored in a MySQL database, ensuring data is saved and can be retrieved across sessions.

## Requirements

- **Java 8 or later**
- **MySQL Database**: MySQL server and MySQL Workbench for managing the database.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for connecting Java to MySQL.
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-compatible IDE.
- **MySQL Connector**: MySQL JDBC driver (e.g., `mysql-connector-java.jar`).
